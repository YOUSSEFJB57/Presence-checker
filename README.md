# Face Recognition Web Application

This project consists of a backend and frontend application for real-time face recognition. The backend is built using Flask, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library, while the frontend uses React with `react-webcam` for capturing images.

## Backend

The backend is responsible for handling face recognition requests and processing images. It uses Flask to serve an API endpoint (`/api/recognize`) that accepts an image and returns recognized faces along with timestamps.

### Installation (Backend)
